    "# Coursework 2: Fish Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Created by Athanasios Vlontzos and Wenjia Bai\n",
    "\n",
    "In this coursework, you will be exploring the application of convolutional neural networks for image classification tasks. As opposed to standard applications such as object or face classification, we will be dealing with a slightly different domain, fish classification for precision fishing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In precision fishing, engineers and fishmen collaborate to extract a wide variety of information about the fish, their species and wellbeing etc. using data from satellite images to drones surveying the fisheries. The goal of precision fishing is to provide the marine industry with information to support their decision making processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here your will develop an image classification model that can classify fish species given input images. It consists of two tasks. The first task is to train a model for the following species:\n",
    "- Black Sea Sprat\n",
    "- Gilt-Head Bream\n",
    "- Shrimp\n",
    "- Striped Red Mullet\n",
    "- Trout\n",
    "\n",
    "The second task is to finetune the last layer of the trained model to adapt to some new species, including:\n",
    "- Hourse Mackerel\n",
    "- Red Mullet\n",
    "- Red Sea Bream\n",
    "- Sea Bass\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be working using a large-scale fish dataset [1].\n",
